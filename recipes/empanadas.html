    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Empanadas are a type of pastry filled with a variety of ingredients, typically meat, cheese, or vegetables. The dough is usually folded over the filling, creating a half-moon shape, and then baked or fried. They are popular in many Latin American countries, Spain, and other parts of the world. The fillings can vary greatly depending on the region and personal preference, with variations such as beef, chicken, spinach, or even sweet fillings like chocolate or fruit. Empanadas are often served as appetizers, snacks, or part of a meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour </li> 
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup (6 ounces) unsalted butter, chilled and cut into ½-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ cup water, as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, seeds removed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon smoked sweet paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>3 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup pitted green olives (Picholine or Spanish preferred), cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 large egg whites, for sealing the empanadas (save the egg yolks if you prefer baking over frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the empanada dough, place the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and pulse to combine. With the food processor on, slowly add the butter cubes through the feed tube.</li>
        <li>With your food processor still on, add the egg. Slowly pour in the ¼ cup of water. Continue to add water, a little at a time, until the dough forms into a ball. Remove the dough from the food processor and divide it into two balls. Using the palm of your hand, slightly flatten the balls into disks. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
        <li>To prepare the filling, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add the bell pepper and sauté for 2 more minutes or until the onions are translucent and the peppers are softened. Add the ground beef along with the cumin, paprika, oregano, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook for approximately 5 minutes, using a wooden spoon to break up the meat and stir the mixture. Add the tomatoes and cook for an additional 2 minutes to soften.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cooked beef mixture to a bowl and cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for one hour before assembling your empanadas.</li>
        <li>Remove one disk of dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the dough until it is approximately ⅛-inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cutter, cut the dough into rounds, transferring them to a parchment-lined baking pan as you go.</li>
        <li>Place a generous amount of filling onto one side of each round, making sure to keep a ½-inch edge. Top with a slice of egg and a few olive slices. Continue with the remaining dough and filling.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the egg whites with a fork. If you are baking the empanadas, save the egg yolks for the glaze. Brush the inside edge of the empanada discs with the egg white mixture and fold closed to create a half-moon shape.</li>
        <li>To seal your empanadas, gently twist and fold the edge of the dough with your fingers or crimp the edge with a fork, making sure there are no holes. Continue filling, folding, and crimping the remaining empanadas. Chill the filled empanadas in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking or frying them.</li>
        <li>While the empanadas are in the refrigerator, prepare the chimichurri sauce. You can find my Argentinian Chimichurri Sauce recipe here.</li>
        <li>Your empanadas can now be baked or fried. If you’d like to fry your empanadas, skip to step 12. If you’re baking them, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Place the chilled empanadas on a parchment-lined baking sheet pan. In a small bowl, combine the yolks and water. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of each empanada with the egg wash. Bake for approximately 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with chimichurri.</li>
        <li>For fried empanadas, heat 4 inches of oil in a large pot. Using a candy or oil thermometer, heat the oil to 365 degrees. Have a sheet pan lined with paper towels ready. Remove 2 to 3 empanadas at a time from the refrigerator and carefully place them in the hot oil. Cook for 5 minutes, turning the empanadas occasionally until both sides are golden brown. Remove from the oil and place on the paper towel-lined pan—this helps absorb excess oil. Check the oil to make sure it is still at 365 degrees and continue with the remaining empanadas, 2 to 3 at a time. You may need to add additional oil as you fry them to maintain a 4-inch depth. Serve with chimichurri sauce.</li>
