    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Similar to the Austrian wiener schnitzel, the Italian cotoletta alla Milanese, and the Japanese tonkatsu, the Argentinian milanesa is also a breaded cutlet shallow-fried in oil. The cutlet typically comes either from the round or from the eye of the round, which are lean cuts, meaning they have less fat, marbling, and sinew when compared to most other cuts of beef. Besides beef, milanesa can also be prepared with veal, pork, or be made vegetarian by using soy cutlets or eggplant instead. The first step when preparing milanesa is to prepare the meat, which means removing any fat or sinew to get as clean of cutlets as possible, which are then pounded with a mallet until a half a centimeter thick. The cutlets are then first dipped typically in a mixture of beaten eggs, chopped garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper, but, depending on the recipe, this mixture can also include mustard. Once soaked in the egg mixture, the cutlets are dredged in breadcrumbs and then shallow-fried in a pan until golden. The milanesa should be served warm, with just a drizzle of lemon juice and a side of mashed potatoes or fries. In Argentina, they also have variations on the basic milanesa, such as caballo, which is milanesa topped with an egg and milanesa a la napolitana, which has a topping of tomato salsa, ham, and mozzarella cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pound of thin cut top round beef steaks 6 steaks</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups of bread crumbs or saltine crackers ground into crumbs</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves chopped</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the garlic clove and peppercorn in a mortar. If you do not have a mortar, finely chop the garlic and use a pepper grinder for the black peppercorns or ground pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the two eggs lightly and add the garlic and peppercorn mixture. I usually add a Tbsp. of water to the mortar after grinding the garlic and peppercorns, that way it’s easier to add the mix to the eggs. Whisk again.</li>
        <li>In a large dish, spread the bread crumbs mixed with salt (If using regular bread crumbs) and have another dish ready to place the steaks after breading.</li>
        <li>Now, to start the breading process. Dip the steaks into the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Using kitchen tongs, place one steak into the crumbs, turn to coat both sides. Patting on lightly to make sure the coating adheres to the steak. If necessary, turn steak again to have an even coating of breadcrumbs. Place the already-breaded steak aside on a plate. I use wax paper to cover the plates for an easy clean up afterward. Repeat this step with the remaining steaks.</li>
        <li>Once you finish breading all the steaks you will proceed to fry them. Using a large skillet, heat ½ inch of oil over medium-high heat. Make sure the oil is hot before placing the steaks. Fry about 3 minutes on each side until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. Place the steaks on paper towels to drain any excess oil before serving.</li>
